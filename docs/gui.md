# User Interface _(GUI)_

You can visit the [repository](https://github.com/janc18/CAE32)
to access all the resources.

To make it more user-friendly and easy for the user, a GUI in Gtk3 is created, written in **C**. The GUI will be capable of:

- Real-time view of the actuator's movement.
- Auto-update of the GUI and microcontrollers whenever possible.
- Configuration of sensors such as limits, dead zone, etc.

The construction of the GUI is done in a Docker container with Debian 11.

## Current Status

At the moment, you can see the current movement of the pedals.
